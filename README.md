This is a modern, responsive portfolio website I built by following [PedroTech’s YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOJ0R5UQOc). The purpose of this project was to **learn how to create my own developer portfolio** using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite** and to customize it further as I grow my skills.
